# Automated-ML-Webapp
In this project I use my favorite python libraries Streamlit, Pandas Profiling, and PyCaret to create a webapp that provides tools for automated data profiling and ML model training and predictions. 

Note: currently experiencing an issue with training a linear regression dataset
